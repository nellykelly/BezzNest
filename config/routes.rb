Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
   root 'users#login'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
  resources :photos, only: [:new, :create, :index, :destroy]
  get '/conversations/convo' => 'conversations#create'
  resources :conversations do
    resources :messages
  end
  delete 'users/delete_notification/:id' => 'users#delete_notification'
  get 'users/:id/generate_friend_request' => 'users#generate_friend_request'
  get 'posts/view/:id' => 'posts#view' 
  get 'users/:id/add_friend' => 'users#add_friend'
  post 'posts/:id/comment' => 'comment#comment'
  get 'users/view/:id' => 'users#view'
  get ':controller(/:action(/:id))'
  post ':controller(/:action(/:id))'
